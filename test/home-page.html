            <ul>
              <li>The help interface has been simplified dramatically. Players will no longer be required to select a category when opening a GM ticket. In addition, players can use the “Talk to a GM” button to fill out a ticket that requires a GM response
                or the “Report Issue” button to fill out a ticket that does not require a GM response.</li>

              <li>The new stopwatch feature can be accessed via the /stopwatch, /sw, or /timer slash commands. Inputting a time into the slash command will make the stopwatch count down. For example, /stopwatch 1:0:0 will make the stopwatch count down from
                an hour, /stopwatch 1:30 will make it count down from 1 minute, 30 seconds, and /stopwatch 30 will make it count down from 30 seconds.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>For ages the red dragonflight and its noble matriarch, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder, have dedicated themselves to preserving all life on Azeroth. Recently, the very heart of this virtuous dragonflight has come under threat.</li>
              <li>An eerie silence has settled over the Ruby Sanctum, the red dragonflight's sacred lair within the Chamber of the Aspects. This troubling development has led to fears that the sanctum, home to Azeroth's largest clutch of red dragon eggs,
                has been breached by an unknown, sinister force. If these claims are true and immediate action is not taken, the benevolent red dragonflight might be crippled forever.</li>

                being applied in all regions, this dungeon will not immediately be available in North America. Stay tuned to our General Discussion forum for an official announcement on the opening of the Ruby Sanctum.</li>
              <li>The functionality of the Vote Kick feature in the Dungeon Finder will now behave differently according to a player's history with the system. Players using the Dungeon Finder who rarely vote to kick players from a group, or rarely abandon
                groups before a dungeon is complete, will find that the Vote Kick option will have no cooldown. For players who frequently abandon groups or vote to kick other players, the Vote Kick option will be kept on a cooldown. This functionality
                will adjust itself as a player's behavior while using the Dungeon Finder changes.</li>

                moved anywhere on the screen.</li>
              <li>Hovering over the Chat Frame and using the mouse wheel will allow players to scroll through chat text.</li>

            <p>Went live on 31-Jan-2012. Available on the Test realm as of 3-Jan-2012. Not on the PTR at the time, but confirmed by Kaivax on the official Dungeons and Raids forum (US).</p>

              <li>Vial of Shadows damage (Lightning Strike) has been reduced to approximately one-third of previous damage. However, it will now trigger approximately 3 times as often. This is intended to keep overall DPS the same while reducing burst damage,

            <p>Patch 4.3.3 (build 15314) appeared without prior notice on the PTR on 18-Feb-2012. A matching 64-bit client was linked for download at the PTR forums that was later updated to build 15338 on 22-Feb-2012 and then build 15354. Due to some unknown
              changes, this patch will not cleanly update with the 64-bit client installed. When Patch 4.3.3 (build 15534) went live, 64-bit client download links were not provided immediately, but added about 3 hours later, although some were provided
              for the PTR earlier.</p>

              post and a Battle.net Support page was added to address 64-bit client issues. The build version was updated to 15531 on April 3rd, 2012, but still no official word on what's in it. Build 15595 appeared on the PTR on April 14th, 2012.

                data problems; although parts of the problems could have been on the server side) that were resolved, in theory, by the hotfix build.</li>
              <li>The first patch build 17807 appeared on the PTR around January 25, 2014. Build 17841 appeared around January 31, 2014. Build 17859 appeared on February 6, 2014. Build 17889 appeared on February 11, 2014. Build 17898 appeared on February
                13, 2014, but had a different date (Feb 11 vs. Feb 12 for Live build), so may have been slightly different from what went live.</li>

              18019 that was released on February 12, 2014. The reasons for this hotfix build are not specifically known, but there could be an official blog upcoming detailing some related hotfixes.</p>

            <p>Patch 7.3.5 build 25848 was released to Live realms on January 16, 2018. Patch 7.3.5 was announced at BlizzCon 2017 with its major feature being a modified version of level scaling coming to the PTR sometime before the end of 2017. For a period
              of builds through early January 2018, the Mac OS X version gave an error (launched to Blizzard Error reporting app) on attempt to launch starting with build 25607 and continuing through build 25717 and back in build 25753 through build 25807.
              Build 25716 through 25744 failed to even find the Mac executable and couldn't even get the Blizzard Error. Part of the problem on Mac OS X may be that now Mac OS X 10.9.x is becoming incompatible with the client, since the minimum version
              is officially 10.10. Starting with Patch 7.3.5, a warning is now given on older OSes about minimum graphics API support.</p>

            <p>World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth is the seventh expansion for World of Warcraft announced at BlizzCon 2017. The Alliance, led by King Anduin and Genn Greymane, attacked Lordaeron, Warchief Sylvanas' base at Undercity, in response to the
              Horde burning down Teldrassil. The factions are at war. Between the Alliance-controlled Eastern Kingdoms and the Horde-controlled Kalimdor is the Great Sea. It is in this Sea that a majority of the expansion will take place.</p>

            <p>Patch 5.4.8 build 18291 went live on May 20, 2014 less than a week after build 18273 appeared on the PTR on May 15, 2014. Build 18224 appeared on the PTR on May 7, 2014, almost two months after the unofficially named Patch 5.4.7 hotfix build
              18019 that was released on February 12, 2014. The reasons for this hotfix build are not specifically known, but there could be an official blog upcoming detailing some related hotfixes.</p>

              <li>Patch 5.4.7 is the name for patch build 17898 that went live on February 18, 2014, but also the hotfix build 17930 that was released on February 20, 2014. The initial Patch 5.4.7 release had many problems (missing mounts and pets; armory
                data problems; although parts of the problems could have been on the server side) that were resolved, in theory, by the hotfix build.</li>
              <li>The first patch build 17807 appeared on the PTR around January 25, 2014. Build 17841 appeared around January 31, 2014. Build 17859 appeared on February 6, 2014. Build 17889 appeared on February 11, 2014. Build 17898 appeared on February
                13, 2014, but had a different date (Feb 11 vs. Feb 12 for Live build), so may have been slightly different from what went live.</li>

              December 17, 2013 slate of hotfixes.</p>

            <p>Patch 7.3.5 build 25848 was released to Live realms on January 16, 2018. Patch 7.3.5 was announced at BlizzCon 2017 with its major feature being a modified version of level scaling coming to the PTR sometime before the end of 2017. For a period
              of builds through early January 2018, the Mac OS X version gave an error (launched to Blizzard Error reporting app) on attempt to launch starting with build 25607 and continuing through build 25717 and back in build 25753 through build 25807.
              Build 25716 through 25744 failed to even find the Mac executable and couldn't even get the Blizzard Error. Part of the problem on Mac OS X may be that now Mac OS X 10.9.x is becoming incompatible with the client, since the minimum version
              is officially 10.10. Starting with Patch 7.3.5, a warning is now given on older OSes about minimum graphics API support.</p>

              Horde burning down Teldrassil. The factions are at war. Between the Alliance-controlled Eastern Kingdoms and the Horde-controlled Kalimdor is the Great Sea. It is in this Sea that a majority of the expansion will take place.
